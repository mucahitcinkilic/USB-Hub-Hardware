# TUSB2077A USB Hub Hardware Design

This project implements a USB hub based on the **TUSB2077A** chip, designed and developed using **Altium Designer**. It is a hardware-only solution, meaning no microcontroller is involved in the USB hub's operation. The design allows for the connection of multiple USB devices through the TUSB2077A, a highly efficient USB hub controller.

## Features

- **USB Hub Functionality**: Supports multiple downstream USB devices using the TUSB2077A chip.
- **Hardware Design**: No microcontroller needed; the system operates purely as a hardware USB hub.
- **Altium Design Files**: Includes schematics and PCB layout files for easy reproduction and customization.
- **Compact and Efficient**: Ideal for embedded systems and custom USB connectivity solutions.

## Hardware Requirements

- **TUSB2077A USB Hub Controller**
- **Altium Designer** (for viewing/editing the design files)
- **Basic USB components** (USB connectors, capacitors, resistors, etc.)
- **Power Supply** for the USB hub circuit

## Circuit Diagram

The design includes a full schematic and PCB layout for building a functional USB hub. The TUSB2077A chip provides the necessary USB switching and signaling, while other components ensure proper data transfer and power management.

You can view or modify the circuit design in **Altium Designer** by opening the provided `.SchDoc` (schematic) and `.PcbDoc` (PCB layout) files.
